        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>I am 25 years old and I've lived in Bogotá city for 6 years, I like coding because I can develop many solutions with different alternatives and all of them lead to the same solution,
                that's one of the reasons I like it, it is very curious how everybody can find different paths to do the same. My biggest dream is being able to manage great projects with an outstanding team, perhaps in my own startup and so I can give to my mom her own house.</p>
